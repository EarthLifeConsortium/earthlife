The goal of the `earthlife` package is to provide a programmatic interface to the EarthLife Consorium's combined API for the Neotoma Paleoecological Database and the Paleobiology Database.  

### Development

*We welcome contributions from any individual, whether code, documentation, or issue tracking.  All participants are expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/EarthLifeConsortium/earthlife/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) for this project.*

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```R

# Find all Canis related fossils:
all_canis <- get_by_taxon("Canis")

```
